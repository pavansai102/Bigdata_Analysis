🎬 Big Data Analysis using PySpark
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Big Data Analysis on a large-scale movie ratings dataset using PySpark. The objective is to demonstrate scalable data processing, analyze user behavior, and extract meaningful insights from millions of records.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains movie ratings provided by users over time.

Columns:

CustId – Unique identifier for customers/users

MovieId – Unique identifier for movies

Rating – Rating given by the user (1 to 5)

Date – Date when the rating was provided

Dataset Characteristics:

Millions of records

Thousands of users and movies

Suitable for big data processing

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

PySpark

Google Colab

Apache Spark

⚙️ Project Workflow

Initialized Spark Session using PySpark

Loaded large dataset into Spark DataFrame

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Analyzed user activity and movie ratings

Performed time-based analysis

Extracted insights from big data processing

Demonstrated scalability using Spark

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Rating distribution analysis

Average rating per movie

Identification of top-rated movies

Most active users analysis

Year-wise trend analysis of ratings

📈 Insights Derived

Majority of users rate movies between 3 and 5, indicating positive feedback.

A small number of users contribute a large portion of total ratings.

Certain movies consistently receive high average ratings.

Movie ratings increased significantly after the year 2000.

PySpark efficiently handled millions of records, proving its scalability for big data tasks.

🚀 Platform Used

Google Colab for cloud-based execution

PySpark for distributed data processing
